Several ESP32 robot projects

## Projects
**robotesp32** -> Touch frame to start autonomous driving with ultrasonic sensor \
**webrobotesp32 [Wifi]** -> Control robot over a web server

## Usage
1. Download code
2. Open up desired Arduino file
3. Download all missing libraries
4. For **[Wifi]** projects, replace "SSID" and "PASSWORD" to connect to the internet
5. Upload code to the robot
6. For **[Wifi]** projects, open the 'Serial Monitor' to get the IP address for the web server
7. For **[Wifi]** projects, copy the IP address and paste it into a web browser

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure the IO ports defined in the code match the ports being used on the robot
